# Project Management

To help provide more structure to the various tasks and goals, this page helps to link and group active tasks. The aim is also to map any dependancies between tasks so that they can be done in order, and any reordering is documented. Dependancy is represented in a heirarchy (easy document formatting) where sub tasks are reliant on parent items being done first.
