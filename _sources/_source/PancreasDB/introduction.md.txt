# Introduction

This is a Transplant Department project to migrate existing workflow and data into a modern, secure, user-friendly, digital-based process and supporting system. Using an incremental approach to the Pancreas Transplant process, we'll be breaking each aspect down and providing the tools and training to allow staff to upgrade working practices and improve clinical data flows, and ultimately patient experience and outcomes.

Current workflows are being mapped in detail, but are primarily based around paper forms and multiple spreadsheets shared between key users. We need to move this data into a secure and multi-user environment, and start to link up parts of the process, as well as increase automation of data updating and gathering.

## Common Terms
* **OUH** - Oxford University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust [http://www.ouh.nhs.uk](http://www.ouh.nhs.uk) 
* **NHSBT** - NHS Blood and Transplant Service [http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk](http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk)
* **IM&T** - OUH's Internal IT department [http://ouhimt.oxnet.nhs.uk/Pages/default.aspx](http://ouhimt.oxnet.nhs.uk/Pages/default.aspx)
* **NDS** - Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford [https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk](https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk)
* **MSD** - Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford [https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk](https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk)
* **MSD-IT** - Medical Sciences Division IT Services, University of Oxford [http://www.imsu.ox.ac.uk](http://www.imsu.ox.ac.uk)
* **OxITS** - University of Oxford IT Services. *Not to be referred to as The IT Services*. [http://www.it.ox.ac.uk](http://www.it.ox.ac.uk)

## Resources
* [NHSBT Technology Blog](http://blogs.nhsbt.nhs.uk/category/technology/) - granted it's only a single article from 2015, but more may appear.
* [NHSBT Main Website](http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk) - is unfortunately about as useful for technical content as the blog site. Even the strategy document that forms the bulk of the non-news content doesn't mention data services or improving data communications between hospitals and the service.
* [OUH Intranet](http://home.oxnet.nhs.uk) - source of all published information (e.g. policies) from the Trust. Don't get excited, there's not as much here as we would hope for, so we'll be collecting what we need from the relevant people/teams/functions/departments directly as it's often not available online.
* [IM&T Intranet](http://ouhimt.oxnet.nhs.uk/Pages/default.aspx) - even less useful content than on the main OUH staff intranet, and don't mention the large number of broken links... :-(

## Key Objectives
* Removal of all clinical data from local desktops to a maintained service
* Automation of data gathering to reduce need for rekeying data from other clinical data sources
* Digitisation of data transfer to NHSBT
* Provide clinical evaluation overviews for service improvement
