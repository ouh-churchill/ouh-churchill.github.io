# Pancreas DB Project

Service Evaluation DB 

* Reporting to NHSBT - Shirley Lockhart (Specialist Nurse) and Simon Northover + Rob Cookston
* Pre-op spreadsheet data for matching, paper, emails
* Maintain active data

Later work on updating clinical processes with electronic systems.


## Meeting 2/9/16 - CM Notes
Process:

* Organ offered, with NHSBT number (often for a specific patient)
* Offer gets reviewed, with option to decline
* On call consultant then gets verbal details, and decides yay or nay
* HLA lab contacted to confirm compatibility
* EOS (NHSBT data) transcribed into spreadsheet

* Reporting done annually (financial year)
* Some bodies report on clinical timing (when transplant happened, i.e. the start), others want after discharge

#### KIDNEYPANCREAS DB xlsx

- Process monitoring. Covers referral to end of listing ready for transplant.
- Reports on 18 week breach date from recipient referral date. In that time they have to been seen, assessed, and listed (clock can be paused)
- Annual cardiac checklist
- List of suspended patients
- Ability to produce a dated report would be handy, looking for patterns of problems
- Maps out the process steps and data at each point, looking for where 
- There's a CRM need to keep all notes, and provide direct linking to copies of emails/documents
- Potential to allow the patients to update their own data and alert on events like holidays
- Report on patients for each referring trust/hospital. Have a system or screen that allows those trusts to see for themselves 
- Mps and echo systems are troublesome

Clinician wants a screen/screens for each patient with all the collected data

#### Pancreas Recipient DB (followup data)

- Tiertiary centres ask for their data from this
- Most/all data comes from
